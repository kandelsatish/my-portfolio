                        Talking about my experience, I worked as a Technical Support Representative at IMS Himalayan Shangrila Pvt. Ltd-one of the leading software companies in Nepal. I gained Solid Technical Skills and working habits from there. I worked there for more than a year. My job was to set up database servers, software setups, provide clients training, and provide technical support in case they needed it.
